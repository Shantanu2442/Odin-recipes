    <ol>
        <li>Heat a pot of saltwater big enough to accommodate your cooked pasta plus an inch or
            two of pasta water (for a pound of pasta,
            you will want four quarts).</li>
        <li>
            <p>When it's boiling (you'll see big bubbles in the water and steam rising from the pot), add your pasta</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>After it comes to a boil again, set a timer to the minutes specified on the pasta box,
                adjusting the flame downward if it begins boiling over, which sometimes happens.</p>
        </li>
        <li>When the timer goes off, drain and rinse the pasta in cool water to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>
            <p>All that's left is adding the sauce. Might we recommend this simple one made from garlic and oil
                ((and from which we adapted our pasta-cooking instructions)?
